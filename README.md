# ionic-PDF

## Description
This is a basic PDF viewer developed in Ionic with core being Angular.<br>
I'm building this app according to my needs. This pdf viewer is like a Library. currently i've kept minimal functionality of listing, viewing of PDFs, located in Books folder of your internal directory only. Ionic dont have any native plugin to open a pdf so it uses sitewart's tool for it called [cleverdox viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.sitewaerts.cleverdox.viewer).

## Installation Ionic
